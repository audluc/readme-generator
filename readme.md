# Title: README project

## Description 
The README project was created to enable the creator of a repo to produce a quality README without investing a lot of time. By incorporating questions with answer critieria, the project produces a README that may include      pertinent information such as; licensing, what is the repo for, how to navigate, and any other information that needs to be relayed to the user. This ensures the user is educated and will have success with the repo.
